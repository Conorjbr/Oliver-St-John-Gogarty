        <div class="bio-texttwo">
            <p> Born 17 August 1878 in Rutland Square, Dublin, the eldest child of Henry Gogarty, a well-to-do Dublin
                physician, and Margaret Gogarty (née Oliver), the daughter of a Galway mill owner.
                Three siblings (Henry, Mary, and Richard) were born later. Gogarty's father
                owned two fashionable homes in Dublin, which set the Gogartys apart from other Irish Catholic families
                at that time and allowed them access to the same social circles as the Protestant Ascendancy.
                Attended the Christian Brothers' O'Connell School (North Richmond Street, Dublin). When his father died
                suddenly in 1891, his family then sent him to Mungret College, a boarding school near Limerick. The
                following year he transferred to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, England. He returned to Ireland in
                1896 and boarded at Clongowes Wood College while studying for his entry to the Royal University of
                Ireland.
                He was a talented athlete. In England he had briefly played for the Preston North End FC Reserve, and
                while at Clongowes he played for the Bohemian FC. He also played on Clongowes's soccer and cricket
                elevens. He was also a prize-winning cyclist. In 1898 he switched to the medical school at Trinity
                College, having failed eight of his ten examinations at the Royal. University. He also enjoyed a highly
                successful cycling career before being banned from the tracks in 1901 for bad language, and between 1898
                and 1901 he rescued at least four people from drowning.
                He became interested in Irish nationalism after meeting Arthur Griffith in 1899, and contributed
                propaganda pieces to The United Irishman over subsequent years. A serious interest in poetry and
                literature also began to manifest itself during his years at Trinity & his witty conversation made him a
                favourite with the dons, particularly John Pentland Mahaffy (formerly the tutor of Oscar Wilde) and
                Robert Yelverton Tyrrell.
                Between 1901 and 1903 he won three successive Vice-Chancellor's prizes for verse. In 1900 he made the
                acquaintance of W. B. Yeats and of George Moore and began to frequent Dublin literary circles.[9] He
                also formed close friendships with other up-and-coming young poets, such as Seamus O'Sullivan and James
                Joyce. In 1904 he spent two terms at Oxford to compete unsuccessfully for the famous Newdigate Prize.
                Upon returning to Dublin in the summer of 1904, Gogarty made arrangements to rent the Martello Tower in
                Sandycove. The primary goal of this scheme was to provide lodging for the then unknown writer James
                Joyce, who was without money and required a year in which to finish his novel. Joyce briefly took up
                residence in the Tower, together with Gogarty and his Oxford friend Samuel Chenevix Trench (a setup
                which later provided inspiration for the opening chapter of Ulysses). Joyce left again suddenly after
                only six days. Forty years later, Gogarty would attribute Joyce's abrupt departure to his and S.C.
                Trench's midnight antics with a loaded revolver. Joyce and Gogarty corresponded intermittently during
                the early years of Joyce's continental exile and occasionally planned meetings, but Joyce always had a
                deep distrust of Gogarty's motives and their friendship was never fully renewed.
                Gogarty made use of the Martello Tower during the following year as a writing retreat and party venue
                and officially held the lease until 1925.
            </p>
            <p> In 1904 and 1905 Gogarty published several short poems in the London publication The Venture and in John
                Eglinton's journal Dana. His name also appeared in print as the renegade priest Fr. Oliver Gogarty in
                George Moore's 1905 novel The Lake.
                In 1905 Gogarty became one of the founding members of Arthur Griffith's Sinn Féin, a non-violent
                political movement with a plan for Irish .
                Medical career and family
                In August 1906, Gogarty married Martha Duane, a girl from a landowning Connemara family. He passed his
                final medical examinations in June 1907, several months after the death of his mother.
                In July 1907 his first son, Oliver Duane Odysseus Gogarty (known as "Noll") was born, and in autumn of
                that year Gogarty left for Vienna to finish the practical phase of his medical training. Gogarty had
                decided to specialise in otolaryngology which he studed in Vienna.
                Returning to Dublin in 1908, Gogarty secured a post at Richmond Hospital, and shortly afterwards
                purchased a house in Ely Place opposite George Moore. Three years later, he joined the staff of the
                Meath Hospital and remained there for the remainder of his medical career. He became known for
                flamboyant theatrics in the operating room, including off-the-cuff witticisms and the flinging of
                recently removed larynxes at the viewing gallery. He also maintained ENT consulting rooms in Ely Place,
                attracting a number of wealthy clients and attending to less well-off patients for free.
                Gogarty and his wife went on to have two more children, Dermot (born 1908) and Brenda (born 1911), and
                in 1917 Gogarty purchased Renvyle House, a large country house in Renvyle, Connemara. He became a keen
                motorist during this time, purchasing a succession of cars that culminated with a buttercup-coloured
                Rolls-Royce. During the following decade he was also interested in aviation, earning a pilot's licence
                and helping to found the Irish Aero Club.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a Sinn Féiner during the Irish War of Independence, Gogarty participated in a variety of anti-Black
                and Tan schemes, allowing his home to be used as a safe house and transporting disguised IRA volunteers
                in his car. Following the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Gogarty sided with the pro-Treaty
                government headed by his close friend Arthur Griffith and was made a Free State Senator in 19322. When
                Griffith fell ill during the summer of 1922, Gogarty frequently attended his bedside. His death on 12
                August 1922 had a profound effect on Gogarty; W.T. Cosgrave later observed that "he was almost mortally
                wounded when Griffith died, he was so attached to him.
                Gogarty carried out Griffith's official autopsy and embalmment, also did the same for Michael Collins
                when he was killed 10 days later. Collins was another close friend whom Gogarty had often sheltered in
                his Ely Place home prior to his assassination. It was rumoured that Griffith had been planning to make
                Gogarty the new Governor-General of the Irish Free State
                In November 1922, anti-Treaty IRA commander Liam Lynch issued a general order to his forces to shoot
                Free State Senators. Two months later, Gogarty was kidnapped by a group of anti-Treaty militants, who
                lured him out of his house and into a waiting car under the pretext of bringing him to visit a sick
                patient. Gogarty was subsequently driven to an empty house near Chapelizod and held under armed guard.
                Aware that he was in danger of execution, Gogarty asked to be brought into the garden (purportedly by
                claiming to be suffering from diarrhoea). There he broke free from his captors and flung himself into
                the Liffey; he then swam to shore and escaped. February of that same year, Renvyle was burnt to the
                ground by anti-Treaty forces.
                Following these incidents, Gogarty relocated his family and practice to London, where he resided until
                February 1924. Upon returning to Ireland, he famously released two swans into the River Liffey in
                gratitude for his life.
                Gogarty remained a senator until the abolition of the Seanad in 1936, during which time he identified
                with none of the existing political parties and voted according to his own whims. He held a number of
                controversial and, for the time, highly liberal opinions on the subjects of medical reforms, birth
                control, women’s rights etc. He was suspicious of the leader of Fianna Fail, Eamonn Devalera, and
                regularly criticised him in the senate. The senate was dissolved by DeValera in 1936, effectively ending
                Gogarty’s political career.
            </p>
            <p> Gogarty maintained close friendships with W. B. Yeats, AE, George Moore, Lord Dunsany, James Stephens,
                Seamus O'Sullivan, and other Dublin literati, and continued to write poetry in the midst of his
                political and professional duties.
                Gogarty devoted less energy to his medical practice and more to his writing during the twenties and
                thirties. His 1924 book of poetry An Offering of Swans won the Gold Medal for poetry at the revived
                Tailteann Games, for which he also wrote the 1924 Olympic bronze medal-winning Tailteann Ode. Gogarty
                was also a member of Yeats's Irish Academy of Letters and frequently assisted in arranging its social
                functions.
                In 1938 he relocated to London for a second time practicing in his medical career and associating with
                many known literary figures of the day.
            </p>
            <p>With the onset of World War II, Gogarty, who was an enthusiastic and talented amateur aviator, attempted
                to enlist in the RAF and the RAMC as a doctor. He was denied on grounds of age. He then departed in
                September 1939 for an extended lecture tour in the United States, leaving his wife to manage Renvyle
                House, which had since been rebuilt as a hotel. When his return to Ireland was delayed by the war,
                Gogarty applied for American citizenship, and eventually decided to reside permanently in the United
                States. Though he regularly sent letters, funds, and care-packages to his family and returned home for
                occasional holiday visits, he never again lived in Ireland for any extended length of time. His primary
                American residence was in New York, where he was known to frequent bars on Third Avenue. He also spent
                time in Vermont and in Wyckoff, New Jersey.
                Feeling that he was too old to sit for the medical examinations that would have qualified him as a
                practitioner in the United States, Gogarty instead chose to support himself entirely by his writing.
                Gogarty's literary output during the forties and fifties is generally considered to be inferior to his
                earlier writings.
                Gogarty suffered from heart complaints during the last few years of his life, and in September 1957 he
                collapsed in the street on his way to dinner. He died on 22 September 1957; his body was flown home to I
                reland and buried in Cartron Church, Moyard, near Renvyle.

                Legacy
                Gogarty is famous as the model for “Buck Mulligan” in James Joyce’s Ulysses.
                A pub in the Temple Bar district of Dublin is named after him, and an annual Oliver St. John Gogarty
                An annual Literary Festival is held in the author's family home, now the Renvyle House Hotel in
                Connemara.
                A surgical ward in the descendant hospital of his workplace, the Tallaght University Hospital, now also
                bears his name.
