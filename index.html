                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <hr>
                <ol class="list-for-bio">
                    <li>Born 17 August 1878 in Rutland Square, Dublin</li>
                    
                    <li>Attended Christian Brothers' O'Connell School (North Richmond Street, Dublin)1890-92. He then went to Mungret College, a boarding school near Limerick. The following year he transferred to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, England.
                        He returned to Ireland in 1896 and boarded at Clongowes Wood College while studying for examinations with the Royal University of Ireland. </li>

                    <li>He was a talented athlete; in England he had briefly played for the Preston North End FC Reserve, and while at Clongowes he played for the Bohemian FC.
                           He also played on Clongowes's soccer and cricket elevens.</li>
                    <li>1898 he switched to the medical school at Trinity College, having failed eight of his ten examinations at the Royal</li>
                    <li>While at university He became interested in Irish nationalism after meeting Arthur Griffith in 1899, and contributed propaganda pieces to The United Irishman over subsequent years</li>
                    <li>As one of Dublin's "medicos", Gogarty was known to be fond of public pranks[5] and midnight carousing in "the Kips", Dublin's red-light district.[6] He had a talent for humorous and bawdy verse, which quickly made the rounds through the city, and sometimes composed mnemonic lyrics to aid his medical studies</li>
                    <li>He also enjoyed a highly successful cycling career before being banned from the tracks in 1901 for bad language, and between 1898 and 1901 he rescued at least four people from drownin</li>
                    <li>A serious interest in poetry and literature also began to manifest itself during his years at Trinity. His witty conversation made him a favourite with the dons, particularly John Pentland Mahaffy (formerly the tutor of Oscar Wilde) and Robert Yelverton Tyrrell, and between 1901 and 1903 he won three successive Vice-Chancellor's prizes for verse. In 1900 he made the acquaintance of W. B. Yeats (of whom his mother highly approved) and of George Moore (of whom she did not) and began to frequent Dublin literary circles.</li>
                    <li>He also formed close friendships with other up-and-coming young poets, such as Seamus O'Sullivan and James Joyce. In 1904 he spent two terms at Oxford to compete for the Newdigate Prize, but lost to G.K.A. Bell, the future Bishop of Chichester, who became a friend and frequent correspondent over the next few year</li>
                    <li>Upon returning to Dublin in the summer of 1904, Gogarty made arrangements to rent the Martello Tower in Sandycove. The primary goal of this scheme, as described by Gogarty in a letter to G.K.A. Bell, was to "house the Bard" (i.e. James Joyce), who was without money and required "a year in which to finish his novel."[11] The two friends quarrelled in August, however, and Joyce either failed to move in or left shortly after doing so. Joyce briefly took up residence in the Tower the following month, together with Gogarty and his Oxford friend Samuel Chenevix Trench (a setup which later provided inspiration for the opening chapter of Ulysses) but left again suddenly after only six days.  The tower is now the site of the James Joyce museum.</li>
