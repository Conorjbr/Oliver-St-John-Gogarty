                <ol class="list-for-bio">
                    <li>Born 17 August 1878 in Rutland Square, Dublin</li>

                    <li>Attended Christian Brothers' O'Connell School (North Richmond Street, Dublin)1890-92. He then
                        went to Mungret College, a boarding school near Limerick. The following year he transferred to
                        Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, England.
                        He returned to Ireland in 1896 and boarded at Clongowes Wood College while studying for
                        examinations with the Royal University of Ireland. </li>

                    <li>He was a talented athlete; in England he had briefly played for the Preston North End FC
                        Reserve, and while at Clongowes he played for the Bohemian FC.
                        He also played on Clongowes's soccer and cricket elevens.</li>
                    <li>1898 he switched to the medical school at Trinity College, having failed eight of his ten
                        examinations at the Royal</li>
                    <li>While at university He became interested in Irish nationalism after meeting Arthur Griffith in
                        1899, and contributed propaganda pieces to The United Irishman over subsequent years</li>
                    <li>As one of Dublin's "medicos", Gogarty was known to be fond of public pranks[5] and midnight
                        carousing in "the Kips", Dublin's red-light district.[6] He had a talent for humorous and bawdy
                        verse, which quickly made the rounds through the city, and sometimes composed mnemonic lyrics to
                        aid his medical studies</li>
                    <li>He also enjoyed a highly successful cycling career before being banned from the tracks in 1901
                        for bad language, and between 1898 and 1901 he rescued at least four people from drownin</li>
                    <li>A serious interest in poetry and literature also began to manifest itself during his years at
                        Trinity. His witty conversation made him a favourite with the dons, particularly John Pentland
                        Mahaffy (formerly the tutor of Oscar Wilde) and Robert Yelverton Tyrrell, and between 1901 and
                        1903 he won three successive Vice-Chancellor's prizes for verse. In 1900 he made the
                        acquaintance of W. B. Yeats (of whom his mother highly approved) and of George Moore (of whom
                        she did not) and began to frequent Dublin literary circles.</li>
                    <li>He also formed close friendships with other up-and-coming young poets, such as Seamus O'Sullivan
                        and James Joyce. In 1904 he spent two terms at Oxford to compete for the Newdigate Prize, but
                        lost to G.K.A. Bell, the future Bishop of Chichester, who became a friend and frequent
                        correspondent over the next few year</li>
                    <li>Upon returning to Dublin in the summer of 1904, Gogarty made arrangements to rent the Martello
                        Tower in Sandycove. The primary goal of this scheme, as described by Gogarty in a letter to
                        G.K.A. Bell, was to "house the Bard" (i.e. James Joyce), who was without money and required "a
                        year in which to finish his novel."[11] The two friends quarrelled in August, however, and Joyce
                        either failed to move in or left shortly after doing so. Joyce briefly took up residence in the
                        Tower the following month, together with Gogarty and his Oxford friend Samuel Chenevix Trench (a
                        setup which later provided inspiration for the opening chapter of Ulysses) but left again
                        suddenly after only six days. The tower is now the site of the James Joyce museum.</li>
                    <li>Forty years later in America, Gogarty would attribute Joyce's abrupt departure to his and S.C.
                        Trench's midnight antics with a loaded revolver.[13] Joyce and Gogarty corresponded
                        intermittently during the early years of Joyce's continental exile and occasionally planned
                        meetings, but contemporaneous letters from Joyce to his brother reveal deep distrust of
                        Gogarty's motives,[14] and their friendship was never fully renewed. Gogarty made use of the
                        Martello Tower during the following year as a writing retreat and party venue, and officially
                        held the lease until 1925. Forty years later in America, Gogarty would attribute Joyce's abrupt
                        departure to his and S.C. Trench's midnight antics with a loaded revolver.[13] Joyce and Gogarty
                        corresponded intermittently during the early years of Joyce's continental exile and occasionally

                        held the lease until 1925. </li>
                    <li>In 1905 Gogarty became one of the founding members of Arthur Griffith's Sinn Féin, a non-violent
                        political movement with a plan for Irish autonomy modelled after the Austro-Hungarian dual
                        monarc</li>
                    <li>In August 1906, Gogarty married Martha Duane, a girl from a landowning Connemara family. Eager
                        to establish himself with a profession, he passed his final medical examinations in June 1907,
                        several months after the death of his mother. In July 1907 his first son, Oliver Duane Odysseus
                        Gogarty (known as "Noll") was born, and in autumn of that year Gogarty left for Vienna to finish
                        the practical phase of his medical training. Owing in part to the influence of his mentor, Sir
                        Robert Woods, Gogarty had decided to specialise in otolaryngology, and in Vienna he studied
                        under Ottokar Chiari, Markus Hajek, and Robert Bárány</li>
                    <li>Returning to Dublin in 1908, Gogarty secured a post at Richmond Hospital, and shortly afterwards
                        purchased a house in Ely Place opposite George Moore. Three years later, he joined the staff of
                        the Meath Hospital and remained there for the remainder of his medical career. He became known
                        for flamboyant theatrics in the operating room, including off-the-cuff witticisms and the
                        flinging of recently removed larynxes at the viewing gallery. He also maintained ENT consulting
                        rooms in Ely Place, attracting a number of wealthy clients and attending to less well-off
                        patients for free.</li>

                <ol class="list-for-bio">
                    <li>In 1935 Gogarty published his first prose work, As I Was Going Down Sackville Street (subtitled
                        "A Phantasy in Fact"), a semi-fictional novel-memoir that tells, in reverse chronological order,
                        the story of Gogarty's Dublin through a series of interconnected anecdotes and lively characters
                        sketches. </li>
                    <li>Gogarty's output over the next two years was prolific. In 1938 he published I Follow St.
                        Patrick, a historical and geographic portrait of Ireland as told through Gogarty's rambling
                        visits to various sites traditionally associated with St. Patrick; in 1939 he published Tumbling
                        in the Hay, a semi-autobiographical comic novel about medical students in turn-of-the-century
                        Dublin, and Elbow Room, another collection of poetry. In 1938 he relocated to London for a
                        second time and brought forth his own libel suit against the young poet Patrick Kavanagh, whose
                        autobiography The Green Fool said of Kavanagh's first visit to Gogarty's home: "I mistook
                        Gogarty's white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare
                        wife." Gogarty, who had taken offence at the close coupling of the words "wife" and "mistress",
                        was awarded £100 in damages.</li>
                    <li>With the onset of World War II, Gogarty, who was an enthusiastic and talented amateur aviator,
                        attempted to enlist in the RAF and the RAMC as a doctor. He was denied on grounds of age. He
                        then departed in September 1939 for an extended lecture tour in the United States, leaving his
                        wife to manage Renvyle House, which had since been rebuilt as a hotel. When his return to
                        Ireland was delayed by the war, Gogarty applied for American citizenship, and eventually decided
                        to reside permanently in the United States. </li>
                    <li>Though he regularly sent letters, funds, and care-packages to his family and returned home for
                        occasional holiday visits, he never again lived in Ireland for any extended length of time. His
                        primary American residence was in New York, where he was known to frequent bars on Third Avenue.
                        He also spent time in Vermont and in Wyckoff, New Jersey.[43]</li>
                    <li>Feeling that he was too old to sit for the medical examinations that would have qualified him as
                        a practitioner in the United States, Gogarty instead chose to support himself entirely by his
                        writing. In addition to various essays and short stories, his prose output included Going
                        Native, a satire on English social mores, Mad Grandeur and Mr. Petunia, two period narratives
                        composed with an eye to having them optioned as Hollywood films, and Rolling Down the Lea and It
                        Isn't This Time of Year at All!, two loosely constructed memoirs. He also published two books of
                        poems, Perennial and Unselected Poems; a collection of bawdy verse, The Merry Muses of Hibernia,
                        was planned but never completed. Gogarty's literary output during the forties and fifties is
                        generally considered to be inferior to his earlier writings.</li>
                    <li>Gogarty suffered from heart complaints during the last few years of his life, and in September
                        1957 he collapsed in the street on his way to dinner. He died on 22 September 1957; his body was
                        flown home to Ireland and buried in Cartron Church, Moyard, near Renvyle. </li>
                    <li> highly visible and distinctive Dublin character during his lifetime, Gogarty appears in a
                        number of memoirs penned by his contemporaries, notably George Moore's Hail and Farewell, where
                        he goes both by his own name and by the pseudonym "Conan".[45] His most famous literary
                        incarnation, however, is as Buck Mulligan, the irrepressible roommate of Stephen Dedalus in
                        James Joyce's Ulysses. Mulligan quotes a number of songs and poems known to have been written by
                        Gogarty,[46] the most famous of which, "The Song of the Cheerful (But Slightly Sarcastic)
                        Jesus", was originally sent to Joyce as a belated Christmas peace offering after their quarrels
                        of 190</li>
                    <li>Due to his influence on Joyce (he is also sometimes cited as an inspiration for Dubliners
                        character Ignatius Gallaher and Exiles antagonist Robert Hand), Gogarty's name often comes up in
                        Joyce scholarship, though Gogarty's own editors and biographers have complained that these
                        references are frequently inaccurate, owing to Gogarty-related errata in Richard Ellmann's James
                        Joyce and a tendency to conflate the real-life Gogarty with the fictional character of Buck
                        Mulligan</li>
                    <li>A pub in the Temple Bar district of Dublin is named after him, and an annual Oliver St. John
                        Gogarty Literary Festival is held in the author's family home, now the Renvyle House Hotel in
                        Connemara. A surgical ward in the descendant hospital of his workplace, the Tallaght University
                        Hospital, now also bears his name.

                        William Dawson wrote The Lay of Oliver Gogarty about his kidnap and escape.[50][51]

                        A documentary on Gogarty, Oliver St. John Gogarty: Silence Would Never Do was produced in 198

                    <li>Gogarty and his wife went on to have two more children, Dermot (born 1908) and Brenda (born
                        1911), and in 1917 Gogarty purchased Renvyle House, a large country house in Renvyle, Connemara,
                        from Caroline Blake.[19] He became a keen motorist during this time, purchasing a succession of
                        cars that culminated with a buttercup-coloured Rolls-Royce.[20] During the following decade he
                        was also interested in aviation, earning a pilot's licence and helping to found the Irish Aero
                        Club.[21]</li>
                    <li>As a Sinn Féiner during the Irish War of Independence, Gogarty participated in a variety of
                        anti-Black and Tan schemes, allowing his home to be used as a safe house and transporting
                        disguised IRA volunteers in his car.[22] Following the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty,
                        Gogarty sided with the pro-Treaty government (headed by his close friend Arthur Griffith) and
                        was made a Free State Senator.[23] When Griffith fell ill during the summer of 1922, Gogarty
                        frequently attended his bedside. His death on 12 August 1922 had a profound effect on Gogarty;
                        W.T. Cosgrave later observed that "he was almost mortally wounded when Griffith died, he was so
                        very, very much attached to him."[24] Gogarty carried out Griffith's official autopsy and
                        embalmment, and went on to perform the same offices for Michael Collins, another close friend
                        whom Gogarty had often sheltered in his Ely Place home prior to his assassination. It was
                        rumoured that Griffith had been planning to make Gogarty the new Governor-General of the Irish
                        Free State, but in his absence the post went to Tim Healy.</li>
                    <li>In November 1922, anti-Treaty IRA commander Liam Lynch issued a general order to his forces to
                        shoot Free State Senators. Two months later, Gogarty was kidnapped by a group of anti-Treaty
                        militants, who lured him out of his house and into a waiting car under the pretext of bringing
                        him to visit a sick patient. Gogarty was subsequently driven to an empty house near Chapelizod
                        and held under armed guard. Aware that he might be in imminent danger of execution, Gogarty
                        contrived to have himself led out into the garden (purportedly by claiming to be suffering from
                        diarrhoea), where he broke free from his captors and flung himself into the Liffey; he then swam
                        to shore and delivered himself to the protection of the police barracks in Phoenix Park. In
                        February of that same year, Renvyle was burnt to the ground by anti-Treaty forces. Following
                        these incidents, Gogarty relocated his family and practice to London, where he resided until
                        February 1924. Upon returning to Ireland, he famously released two swans into the River Liffey
                        in gratitude for his life.[26]</li>
                    <li>Gogarty remained a senator until the abolition of the Seanad in 1936, during which time he
                        identified with none of the existing political parties and voted according to his own whims. He
                        believed that Ireland should retain its dominion status in the British Commonwealth so as to
                        "keep with nations who understand that the first principle of freedom is a freedom that does not
                        permit interference with the personal liberties of the citizen." He supported rural
                        electrification schemes, road improvement, reforestation and conservation, prevention of
                        livestock cruelty, and educational reform.</li>
                    <li>He was most passionate on the subject of sanitation in schools and in urban and rural housing,
                        about which he spoke frequently.[27] His speeches frequently contained puns, wordplays, and
                        extended poetic quotations, and were sometimes given in favour of facetious schemes, such as his
                        attempt to have the phoenix statue in Phoenix Park included in the 1929 Wild Birds Protection
                        Bill.[28] He was notoriously scornful of the government's attempts to reinstate the Irish
                        language (which he referred to as "Woolworth's Irish"), proposing that funding be used instead
                        for housing and school health services,[29] and remained perpetually suspicious of Éamon de
                        Valera, against whose economic policies, character, and personal appearance he often hurled
                        invectives during Seanad proceedings. De Valera eventually dissolved the Seanad when it
                        persisted in obstructing Government proposals, effectively ending Gogarty's political career

                    <li>Gogarty maintained close friendships with W. B. Yeats, AE, George Moore, Lord Dunsany, James
                        Stephens, Seamus O'Sullivan, and other Dublin literati, and continued to write poetry in the
                        midst of his political and professional duties. Three small books of poetry (Hyperthuleana,
                        Secret Springs of Dublin Song, and The Ship and Other Poems) were published between 1916 and
                        1918.[31] Gogarty also tried his hand at playwriting, producing a slum drama (Blight) in 1917
                        under the pseudonym "Alpha and Omega", and two comedies (A Serious Thing and The Enchanted
                        Trousers) in 1919 under the pseudonym "Gideon Ouseley", all three of which were performed at the
                        Abbey Theatre.</li>
                    <li>Gogarty devoted less energy to his medical practice and more to his writing during the twenties
                        and thirties. His 1924 book of poetry An Offering of Swans won the Gold Medal for poetry at the
                        revived Tailteann Games, for which he also wrote the 1924 Olympic bronze medal-winning Tailteann
                        Ode[33] (which he was later to describe as "rather tripe").[34] In 1929 another book of verse,
                        Wild Apples, was published, and was followed in 1933 by Selected Poems. Gogarty was also a
                        member of Yeats's Irish Academy of Letters and frequently assisted in arranging its social
                        functions. 1936 saw the publication of Yeats's Oxford Book of Modern Verse, which contained
                        seventeen of Gogarty's poems and an introduction proclaiming him "one of the great lyric poets
                        of our age."[35] The over-representation given to Gogarty outraged many poets and perplexed
                        Gogarty himself, who remarked, "What right have I to figure so bulkily? None from a poetical
                        point of view... Sappho herself could not have made a more subjective anthology.</li>
