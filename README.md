# Oliver St John Gogarty
## A website to outline a brief biography of a remarkable Dublin literary figure

I wanted to create a historical website to give some basic biograpical information, pictures, bibliography etc. of a write that I have an interest in.

## General design of site 

I chose a very basic design concept with a plain light grey background and charcoal coloured text.  Most of the font is Verdana as I lik e the clean look of this font.
I decided that 4 pages would be enough to give a brief outlien of this person's life and achievements. I was conscious of adding a lot of text to the biography section and didn't want to overload the reader with too much reading material.










## Responsiveness

I checked the URL in the "Am I Responsive" tool at [Am I responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://conorjbr.github.io/Oliver-St-John-Gogarty/),

See results below.

This checks the website responsiveness at the following screen sizes
Desktop
    1600x992px scaled down to scale(0.3181)
Laptop
    1280x802px scaled down to scale(0.277)
Tablet
    768x1024px scaled down to scale(0.219)
Mobile
    320x480px scaled down to scale(0.219)

Overall the responsiveness looked acceptable.  I also checked all pages and manipulated scren size with DevTools to check this and found results generally acceptable.  If I had more time and skills, I would change mav mene to burger type in the smaller sizes.  I investigated how to do this but found that I had insufficinet time to progress further.
